# Cloud Security Lab

This Cloud Security Lab demonstrates practical security engineering across AWS. 
It includes IAM governance, secure infrastructure automation with Terraform, data protection, incident response workflows,
compliance as code, and monitoring dashboards. While the current focus is AWS, the framework is designed to expand into multi-cloud environments.
