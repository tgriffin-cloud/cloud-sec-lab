# Cloud Security Lab

This Cloud Security Lab is where I explore practical security engineering in the cloud.  
It focuses on IAM governance, automation with Terraform, and hands-on security practices.  
The initial work is in AWS, with a design that can expand into multi-cloud environments.

## Current Work
- **IAM Security Auditor Role (Completed)**
  - MFA-enforced role with AWS managed policies: `SecurityAudit` and `ReadOnlyAccess`
  - SecurityAuditors group and membership
  - Role assumption tested and verified using AWS STS + MFA

## Scope
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) with least-privilege design  
- Secure infrastructure automation with Terraform (IaC)  
- Data protection and incident response workflows  
- Compliance as code and monitoring dashboards  

## Tools
- AWS: IAM, STS, S3, DynamoDB, CloudTrail  
- Terraform for infrastructure as code  
- GitHub for version control and documentation
